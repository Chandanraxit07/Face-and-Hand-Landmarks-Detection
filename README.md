Overview:

Face and hand landmarks detection projects leverage computer vision techniques to identify and track key points on human faces and hands in images or videos. Using Python, two popular libraries for such tasks are Mediapipe and OpenCV.

Mediapipe:


Mediapipe is a powerful library developed by Google that offers cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. It simplifies the process of building and deploying perception pipelines, particularly for face and hand tracking.

Key Features:



Face Detection and Landmark Identification: Detects facial regions and 468 facial landmarks, useful for applications like facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality (AR).
Hand Detection and Landmark Identification: Detects hands and 21 key points per hand, enabling applications in gesture recognition and hand pose estimation.
Real-time Performance: Optimized for real-time applications, leveraging GPU acceleration.
